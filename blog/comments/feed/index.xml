		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using GoDaddy: https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting. The cheapest plan is great, and they have amazing support (My site was rmed and they recovered everything). Thanks! To help speed up my site, I am using Google PageSpeed Insights (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). It tells what to do to speed up your site. I also do &#060;script ASYNC... in the script tags for things like bootstrap. I&#039;m a little worried that all the code I am injecting might slow it down, though.]]></description>
