<p>I have decided to add some new features to my site. Now some code is automatically added to my site. For example, now I can use&nbsp;<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">Markdown</a>. That is a new feature I added. My site also automatically adds LaTeX. Apparently Wordpress doesn't like my new "&#60;&#109;&#100;&#62;" tags, so I can't use Markdown in Wordpress.</p>
