<p>So, before we get started, I need to define some things.<br />
<strong>Right Triangle</strong>:<br />
A right triangle is a triangle with a right angle.<br />

<strong>Pythagorean Theorem<br />
</strong>The Pythagorean Theorem says that [latex]a^2+b^2=c^2[/latex]. [latex]a[/latex] and [latex]b[/latex] are the two shorter sides of the right triangle. The long side is called the hypotenuse. From now on we will refer to [latex]c[/latex] as [latex]h[/latex]. If we want to get [latex]h[/latex], instead of [latex]h^2[/latex], we can do [latex]h=\sqrt {a^2+b^2}[/latex]</p>

<p>Ok. Now that we're done with that, we can start actually calculating distance. This part is pretty simple. Imagine we have a cat that wants to get to a mouse, but needs to know how far away it is. The cat is at 0,0, and the mouse is at 5,5. Let's call the cat's x and y "cx" and "cy" , and let's call the mouse's x and y "mx" and "my".In many of these equations, I will be using [latex]||[/latex] a lot. If a number is between those bars, it means that it will be made positive ([latex]|-5|=5[/latex]). First, we find [latex]|cx-mx|[/latex], and we find [latex]|cy-my|[/latex]. These are the differences between the x values and the y values. Now we take those numbers (let's call them "dx" and "dy"). To get [latex]h^2[/latex], we do [latex]h^2=dx^2 + dy^2[/latex]. Now we can do [latex]h=\sqrt {h^2}[/latex]. We are done. [latex]h[/latex] is our distance. This seems long, but we just produced a short formula to find distance. Here is the completed formula: [latex]h=\sqrt {(|cx-mx|)^2+(|cy-my|)^2}[/latex]<br />
For those of you still having trouble, this might help explain why you can't just add dx and dy, and why you are using right triangles:<br />
